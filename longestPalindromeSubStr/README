Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring in s. You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.

Example 1:

Input: "babad"
Output: "bab"
Note: "aba" is also a valid answer.
Example 2:

Input: "cbbd"
Output: "bb"

Approach 5: Manacher's Algorithm
There is even an O(n)O(n) algorithm called Manacher's algorithm, explained here in detail. However, it is a non-trivial algorithm, and no one expects you to come up with this algorithm in a 45 minutes coding session. But, please go ahead and understand it, I promise it will be a lot of fun.
